# Point of View Finder

This python script will try and determine the point of view of a block of text based on how many keywords it finds.

## Status

VERY broken, as the frequency of keywords is unreliable, especially when quotations are part of the text as they tend to break the POV rules. Another thing to note is that the outcome is not always formatted correctly, so it may bug out and give a wrong answer even if it came up with the right result. This is rather rare, however.
